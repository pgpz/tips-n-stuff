- Privacy Badger ; everyone boasts about this, but its great for low sec avoidance of fingerprinting and stuff.
- PortAuthority ; automatically blocks malicious websites from scanning your ports & blocks data collection scripts
- uBlock Origin ; obviously, but please research it more. very good extension.
- DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials ; good for not getting your data scraped like its alcohol in 1920

do not use this an excuse to not take other privacy measures. extensions will never fully protect you. there is no such thing as a "shield" or downloadable opsec.

please take your own time to learn these topics!
